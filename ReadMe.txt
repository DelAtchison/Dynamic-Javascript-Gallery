Dynamic Gallery made by DelAtchison - http://www.adeleatchison.co.uk/

Images (created my DelAtchison) included for demo purposes only.

You can insert hyperlinks in the descriptions for an image by following the description text with the following code (close the "" first):
+ '<a href="YourLinkHere">LinkTitleHere.</a>'

This gallery can be made responsive using entirely CSS, simply adjust the imageholders to suit your requirements. 

This gallery best suits landscape images and these will display best, however portrait images will also work just beware they will appear smaller.
